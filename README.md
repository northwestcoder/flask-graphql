### Simple Hello World GraphQL Server


#### Steps



1. edit the database connection variables at the top of models.py
2. We tested with python 3.10.4
3. run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. launch the flask server: ```python main.py```

This assumes you have a database available that matches the schema shown in schema.py, e.g. two tables named graphql_people and graphql_transactions
